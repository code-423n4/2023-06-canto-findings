## Approach taken
I first went through the overview of onboarding middleware to have a brief understanding of what it does and why
Then I dive straight to the contract before touching deep to get an understanding of the HOW it works in terms of the code implementation marking any potential issue in my inline note marks
After this, is when I really try to get a deep understanding of the seperate components and protocol as a whole by going through the readme and also read any resource online
then I go through my audit check list and verifying the inline note marks issue.

## What I learned
What I learnt alot from the protocol's error tackling about it's error handling methodology

## comments for the judge
In some findings, I might provided related helpful links

### Time spent:
4 hours
