# Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
Utilized a methodical approach , but due to unfamiliarity with Go language, i had to use some tools to help see if I can identify common vulnerabilities. 

# Anything that you learned from evaluating the codebase
Had a better view of the complexities involved in token swap implementations, particularly within the context of blockchain. Atleast a better view than before deciding to start with the contest.

On a personal level, it emphasized that code auditing is a continuous process requiring patience and attention to detail. "It's a marathon, not a sprint". So as I gain more experience and expertise, I can progressively tackle more complex codebases and languages like Go in the future.

# Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings
Unfortunately I couldn't find any issues, but that doesn't mean that code is flawless. It reflects the code's quality (or atleast the fact that more experienced auditors should be the one to engage this) and as such means it's pretty a solid codebase, so planning on coming back to this after the audit ends to find out the issues for myself, and lastly goodluck with the judging, appreciate the work you guys do!
