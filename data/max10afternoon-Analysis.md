This audit offered me the opportunity to discover and learn about the cosmos sdk (of which I had heard before, but never truly dug into), especially in the 2 days leading up to the contest (having noticed that cosmos was the technology predominantly used by Canto). This was very helpful to better learn about the technology behind app specific blockchains and the IBC. Also after bunch of months spent on solidity using Go was a nice refresher. 
Due to this novelty aspects I tried to focus mostly on the general logical flow of the code in scope (which is mostly technology agnostic), and I treated any interactions with the overall infrastructure as a blackbox. 
On top of the preparation leading up to it, due to personal reasons, I was only able to spend 2 of the 3 days available auditing on this codebase.

### Time spent:
10 hours
